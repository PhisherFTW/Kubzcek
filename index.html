                    <br> 
                    Round.buy,Notes.W/L
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, B rush, nice commitment but you should never run through a molly that has been on the group longer than 1.5 seconds as it will destroy your health, unforuantley you ran through mollies that had been on the ground for a while and this ended up burning you to death. L</li>
                    <li>p250, nice attempt at peeking out ramp, but the distance you were taking the engagement from is not ideal, generally, you need to focus on being within your weapon's optimal range, this is the range at which the weapon is the most deadly and effective, ramp to bottom stairs was outside that range which caused you to lose that fight. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at flashing out middle, a wiffed spray on the enemy short from the bottom middle nearly let an enemy get away luckily your teammate was there to back you up, some missed movement towards window gave away your position under window which could have been negative, jumping on chair exposed your head to catwalk which could have gotten you killed but you stayed in the same angle after being spotted which did get you killed as the enemy trained his crosshair placement on you and prefired. W</li>
                    <li>UMP buy, solid jungle cross smoke, and nice lamp flash, but you were being overly aggressive jumping to top stairs which could have easily gotten you punished and then again overly aggressive peeking connector eventually getting you killed by the enemy catwalk. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice entrying onto B, but your pathing was not optimal and this forced you to jump out window which exposes you to many angles at once, good adjustment to the enemy short but you didn’t move after your initial engagement and then on the second peek the enemy could preaim you perfectly. W</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, nice utility out ramp, nice reaction to the flash from site and good play to dodge it, nice kill on the enemy default and good reaction to the enemy palace, nice idea to flank CT but it was a little obvious after your teammate died on A causing the enemy jungle to peek you, again you stayed in basically the same position after being spotted which allowed the enemy to easily line you up and then prefire you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at taking middle control again, jumping on the bench where you can be short from catwalk, nice idea to molly catwalk but you didn’t need to go into connector to do that which is what got you killed as you accidentally exposed yourself to an enemy site. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice early B smoke, and good idea to flash over B, but your position holding for aggression is a little obvious when there is a better position available, good job being weary of the push through B apps, weird decision to walk after already running apps so the enemy catwalk knew you were there but your crosshair placement and peek were better so you got the kill, nice plant on site but you played overly passive allowing the enemy to simply walk out kitchen and into an angle by van you did not expect at all. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice utility towards A, but pathing wasn’t the best and you went overly aggressive taking super dangerous and disadvantageous fight towards connector. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice entry onto B site, but your team didn’t clear back pillar which could have gotten you killed also you went again hyper-aggressive catwalk and peeked out into 2 enemies, I would have recommended playing more passive and letting the enemies run into your crosshair. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice peek out onto A site with a nice entry kill on site, but your pathing on A wasn’t ideal especially after the jungle smoke faded which nearly got you killed once and then someone dropped a bad jungle smoke which did get you killed. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice entrying onto B, and better pathing this time, also allowing you to secure a kill on the enemy short off-angle short wasn’t ideal as when the enemy peeks site you perfectly lineup with his preaim. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice B smoke, unfortunatley the enemy again drops a deep molly which ends up delaying your apps take, solid push-through lowers and up connector allowing you to catch an enemy on site off-guard but you get left in a 1v2 situation and when you go back into middle there is an enemy sitting top middle waiting for you. L</li>
                    <li>p250, during eco/full save rounds your objective should be something along the lines of, “how can I can my first engagement within the optimal range of my current weapon” so you don’t want to take far range fights with the p250, nice movement onto B site, and luckily it was completely empty, your positioning right side bench was a bad idea instead you should have played around your teammate bench baiting for him basically showing the enemy that there was no other enemy there. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice flash-out middle and good idea to molly winodw unfortunately you missed your molly window, nice job moving up connector but you wiffed your spray onto the enemy site and then adjusted to the enemy stairs who you did kill but because of your initial wiff the enemy site peeked and killed you. W</li>
                    <li>CT Pistol armour, good job playing fill, nice communication, positioning for the apps aggression is not ideal as the enemy can close the distance between you and them extremely easily when you play next to Van towards Bench side, and this was demonstrated as after he dinked you he was able to close the distance quite effectively. W</li>
                    <li>UMP, nice early molly ramp, although your position stairs with the UMP is not ideal as with SMGs you want to play much much closer range, you got caught off-guard by an enemy pushing behind you connector. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, unfortunately you got caught off-guard by an enemy coming up connector again. L</li>
                    <li>p250, again during these rounds your objective should be get as close as possible, your positioning wood box on B was not ideal as it left you way outside of your weapons optimal distance towards apps and without any cover, so the enemy was easily able to deal with you while on a full buy. L</li>
                    <li>p250, you were peeking ramp from top stairs this is still significantly outside of the optimal range of the p250 and there was a very little chance of getting this kill unless you landed an instant double dink. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, little bit of a late cross to bottom stairs from CT could have gotten you in trouble, unfortunately, the enemies were hyper-aggressive and this led to them jumping window early and catching you off-guard. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, usually what I recommend when playing with the famas is use it like its an upgraded SMG only play medium to close range fights and don’t engage in rifle v rifle fights outside of close range, nice kill on the enemy connector and interesting idea to flash but unfortunately you ended up blinding your teammate a little bit, you did then go for the kill which allowed you to get the trade on him but sadly you then got flanked from window. L</li>
                    <li>p250, dangerous pathing bench side and then into sandwich basically free kill for the players ramp early, the sandwich position can be effective if your position remains unknown but you took an early engagement on the enemy palace who had a huge advantage in this fight, and ended up killing you. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, an interesting flash-out connector but I would usually recommend one over the top of connector rather than through as the one through connector doesn’t usually cover all the potential positions very well, unfortunately, one of these potential positions is catwalk so the enemy peeking connector from catwalk wasn’t blind at all when you had your fight. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, some sort of incorrect buying as you shouldn’t have to have a famas 3 times in 4 rounds, try to get M4 more often as the famas is really bad against AKs making gun fights even more difficult, jumping out market window towards B was dangerous and got you killed without checking all the angles before jumping. L</li>
                    <li>P250, again taking fights outside of the optimal range, this time the enemy actually rushes you bottom stiars and puts himself within the optimal range of your gun and this gets you your first kill with p250 and then after collecting his weapon you go onto get a nice second kill. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, good awareness being slow and looking for a flank, this nearly allows you to catch the enemy short but he evades you, no action. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, nice early ramp molly, weird positioning top palace trying to look over the smoke thrown towards ramp, this is a bit dangerous as you have no cover. interesting aggression into ramp but it works out and allows you to get the kill on the enemy ramp, after that you go agro towards connector which is where the second enemy is unfortunately you put yourself within the optimal range of his pistol and this gives him the advantage in this fight close connector even though you have a rifle. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good late trade on the enemy pushing jungle but you wiffed your spray a bit allow the enemy to do a lot of damage to you, and then you get finished off with a grenade from another enemy. W</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you during that game, did you get the poistions you wanted? <br> In-game kind of had the positions I wanted and usually pushed banana without a molly but during this game the molly was dropped every round which was a bit of an inconvienience, and CT side I was pretty comfortable in any position, but teammates started communicating in Russian which was a bit of an inconvienience.</li>
                    <li>How did your crosshair placement feel? <br> Crosshair placement was quite okay but still needs to do a lot of work when looking to preaim for a headshot </li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during flicks? <br> Muscle memory was okay but missed some shots I should have hit, and usually I get cold hands during games over. </li>
                    <li>How did your movement and rotations feel? <br> For me and my standard it was okay but I bumped into a few things, and it should have been quicker at some points.</li>
                    <li>How did your positioning feel? <br> I didn’t catch any shots this time where it was super obvious standing out in the open</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br> I didn’t throw that much utility, but a few times when I did want to throw utility the enemy was already standing in-front of me, but the flashes for banana were quite good, </li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel, did you give consistent calls throughout the entire game and were you calling the correct positions and giving correct information? <br> Yea but usually when I play with friends I give more information and during this game I kept my info to the bare minimum.</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br> I would pick the whole group again. </li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing could you immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br> Really not very stable with flashes, tend to only buy flashes when he knows where he is going to be using them and not the rest of the time</li>
